## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

Personal goals:

- Implement layout as close as possible to the design
- Use relative sizing units such as rem
- Use Vercel to upload project to a live site

## My process

TODO: .this

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid & template areas
- Desktop-first workflow
- Elm Emmet abbreviations for HTML


### What I learned

TODO: .this

So far:
- CSS Grid template areas
- CSS box-sizing property
- CSS custom properties
- Git version control and GitHub repositories
- GitHub SSH keys


Ongoing:
- Responsive layouts with media queries
- CSS rem, em and vh
- Markdown syntax 


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

### Continued development

Thoughts for future projects: 
- Use Vite.js for faster frontend development and package management
- Use Tailwind CSS for faster styling and responsiveness so scaling

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp.org - Git and Github for Beginners](https://www.example.com) - Great video that helped me to figure out SSH keys and general branching in GitHub Repos
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) - Markdown Syntax 101 for better README's!
